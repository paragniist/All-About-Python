    "As your teacher, let me tell you upfront: logging is absolutely essential for your GenAI engineering journey. Think of logging as your detective toolkit - it's what separates professional developers from beginners. In GenAI applications, where models can behave unpredictably and processing pipelines are complex, logging isn't just helpful - it's mission-critical.\n",

When something goes wrong (and it will), logs are your breadcrumbs leading you to the problem. Without proper logging, debugging a failed AI pipeline is like searching for a needle in a haystack while blindfolded.\n",
