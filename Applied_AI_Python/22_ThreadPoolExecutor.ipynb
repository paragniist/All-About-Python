    "### **1️⃣ What is ThreadPoolExecutor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It’s a simple way to run multiple tasks **at the same time using threads**.\n",
    "* Instead of manually creating and managing threads, Python gives us a \"pool\" (a group) of threads that we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Your code step by step**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Importing**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "import time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ThreadPoolExecutor`: Helps us run multiple threads easily.\n",
    "* `time`: We use `time.sleep()` just to simulate a delay (like waiting for a network call).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Define the task**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_numbers(number):\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)\n",
    "    return f\"Number: {number}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the function each thread will run.\n",
    "* It waits **1 second** (simulating a slow task) and then returns the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Create the list of work**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]\n",
    "```\n",

    "* This is the list of numbers we want to process.\n",
    "* Each number will be passed to `print_numbers()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Create a thread pool**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n",
    "    results = executor.map(print_numbers, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* We create a **pool of 3 threads** (`max_workers=3`).\n",
    "* `executor.map()` sends each number from `numbers` to the function `print_numbers()`.\n",
    "* Only 3 numbers are processed at the same time because we only have 3 threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Get results**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `results` is like a list of returned values from each thread.\n",
    "* We loop through and print each result when it’s ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ What actually happens in real time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Threads 1, 2, 3 start processing numbers **1, 2, 3** at the same time.\n",
    "2. After 1 second, they finish, and the next 3 numbers **4, 5, 6** start.\n",
    "3. This continues until all 13 numbers are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Why is this faster than normal (single-threaded)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you had run `print_numbers()` one by one, it would take:\n",
    "  `13 numbers × 1 second = 13 seconds`\n",
    "* With 3 threads working together, the time is closer to:\n",
    "  `13 numbers ÷ 3 threads ≈ 5 seconds`\n",
    "* Because they work **in parallel**, especially helpful for tasks that spend time \"waiting\" (like I/O).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mini-check for you:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we change `max_workers=5`, will it finish faster or slower? And why?\n",
